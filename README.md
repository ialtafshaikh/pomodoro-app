# Pomodoro App

A Javascript application based on Pomodoro Technique

##  Pomodoro Technique

Pomodoro is a time management technique developed in the 1980s which uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 

## Getting Started

A Pomodoro timer is a simple application that keeps you focused and productive by scheduling work and break sessions consecutively. 

The Pomodoro timer build implements the Pomodoro technique perfectly and tells you exactly when to work and when to take a short break. The basic process is as follows:

-   Start a 25-minute timer.
-   Work until the timer rings.
-   Take a short, five minutes break.
-   Every four pomodoros, take a longer break (15 minutes).

## Additional Features

1. Allows Keyboard event to control the timer
	-  Press P : Pomodoro Mode
	-  Press S: Short Break Mode
	-  Press L: Long Break Mode
	- Press Space Bar: Play/Pause the timer
2. Timer goes red if timer reaches to 2min
3. Blink effect on clock
4. Browser Notification to User
5. Playing sound on clock start, stop and on mode switch
6. Fully Mobile Responsive App
